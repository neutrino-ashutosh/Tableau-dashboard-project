### Problem Statement

The well-being and academic success of students are significantly influenced by multiple lifestyle and psychological factors including sleep, study patterns, academic pressure, and financial stress. Understanding the relationships among these variables can help institutions design more student-centric policies to enhance academic satisfaction and performance.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

- Sleep Duration (SD): Distribution of students across different sleep brackets.

- Study Hours (SH): Variation in number of students based on average daily study hours across 12 time units.

- Study Satisfaction (SS): Student count categorized by satisfaction level from 1 (lowest) to 5 (highest).

- Academic Pressure (AP): Student distribution based on levels of perceived academic stress.

- Financial Stress (FS): Count of students facing various levels of financial challenges.

## Sleep Analysis

- Sleep duration shows a bimodal distribution, with 123 students sleeping 5–6 hours and less than 5 hours, while 128 students report sleeping 7–8 hours and more than 8 hours.

- This indicates polarized sleep behavior, potentially influenced by academic workload or lifestyle factors.

- Equal student count at both healthy and unhealthy sleep extremes may point to a need for sleep hygiene awareness programs.

## Study Hours Trend

- The line chart reveals fluctuating study hour patterns with student counts ranging from 29 to 53 across time intervals.

- Peak study participation is observed at unit 10 with 53 students, while a noticeable dip appears at unit 1 (29 students), indicating varying motivation or workload across the academic period.

- A general upward trend is observed from unit 5 to unit 10, followed by a minor drop.

## Study Satisfaction Distribution

- Satisfaction level SS-4 (SC-116) has the highest student count, followed by SS-3 (SC-103) and SS-2 (SC-100).

- Lower satisfaction levels (SS-1 and SS-2) still account for 186 students combined, suggesting room for improvement in teaching methods or curriculum design.

- Only 97 students report maximum satisfaction (SS-5), highlighting a potential gap in overall academic contentment.

## Academic Pressure Insights

- Most students (SC-125) report moderate pressure (AP-3).

- A significant number of students also face extreme pressure (AP-5, SC-98).

- Lowest pressure (AP-1) is experienced by only 99 students, suggesting that academic stress is widespread and requires intervention.

## Financial Stress Distribution

- Financial stress levels are evenly distributed:

- FS-1 (Low stress): 110 students

- FS-5 (High stress): 96 students

- Mid-level FS-2 to FS-4 range between 94–102 students

- Indicates that nearly equal proportions of students are under various levels of financial strain, necessitating financial aid or counseling programs.

## Summary Insights

- Balanced but extreme sleep behavior in students is evident, calling for health awareness.

- Study engagement fluctuates but shows a rising pattern mid-academic term.

- Majority of students report moderate satisfaction and pressure, showing opportunity for optimizing course delivery.

- Financial stress is pervasive, potentially impacting academic outcomes and well-being.
